# Appcent NewsApp

Appcent NewsApp is a classic news application developed in Swift using the UIKit framework and follows the MVVM architecture pattern. The app retrieves news from the NewsAPI website. It features a search function on the main page to filter news based on user input, and tapping on a news item navigates the user to a detailed view. In the detailed view, there is a "Read More" button that directs the user to the original news website. Additionally, the detailed view has functionality to share the news item and add it to favorites using the buttons located in the top right corner.

## Features

- **Main Page**: Displays a list of news articles. Users can search for articles based on keywords.
- **Detail Page**: Shows detailed information about a selected news article, including the ability to navigate to the original article's website.
- **Sharing**: Users can share news articles via various platforms.
- **Favorites**: Users can add news articles to their favorites list, which is accessible from the second page. Articles in the favorites list can be easily removed if desired.
